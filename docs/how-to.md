### Import Transactions

After that export some Transactions from your Online Banking and import the data using `Import Page`. At the moment it support CSV files only but you can individually set the characters for delimiter and text qualifier. The respective settings and other options are shown once the CSV file has been uploaded.

You also need to create an initial Transaction which includes the Bank Balance on a certain date. It should be the previous day of the very first imported Transaction. You can do this on the `Transaction Page`.

Example:

You have imported all Transactions starting 2020-01-01. To have the right Balances create a Transaction for 2019-12-31 and add as amount the Account Balance of this day. You can mark this Transaction as `Income` (see more explanation in section `Bucket Assignment`).

### Create Buckets

Once you have some Transactions imported you can start creating Buckets on the `Bucket Page`. If you don't know what kind of Buckets you need, maybe start with some Buckets for your monthly or even yearly expenses like Car Insurance, Property Taxes, Instalments etc. and Buckets for your regular needs like Groceries or Gas. You can also create a Bucket for your next big trip by putting some money into it every month.

If you are happy with your setup, put some money into your Buckets. You can do it manually or automatically if a Bucket has a Want for the current month.

### Bucket Assignment

In the final step you assign your Transactions to certain Buckets. Go back to the `Transaction Page`, edit a Transaction and select an appropriate Bucket. You can also do a mass edit. If a Transaction belongs to more than one Bucket just reduce the assigned amount and you get automatically the option to assign the remaining amount to another Bucket.

Transactions which represent your (monthly) income can be assigned to the pre-defined `Income` Bucket. If you have transferred money from one Account to another you can use the `Transfer` Bucket. Please ensure that all `Transfer` Transaction have in total a 0 Balance to prevent data inconsistency and wrong calculations.

Once all Transactions are assigned properly you can go back to the Bucket Overview to see if your Budget management is still fine or if you need to do some movements. You should always ensure that your Buckets don't have a negative Balance. Also your `Remaining Budget` should never be negative.

### Bucket History

OpenBudgeteer has a built-in versioning for Buckets which enables a proper history view on previous months. If you modify a Bucket, like changing the Type or the Target Amount, it will create a new version for the current selected month. It is not recommended to change a Bucket in the past, a change between two Bucket Version is prevented.

If you close a Bucket it will be marked as `Inactive` for the next month. This can be only done if the Bucket Balance is 0 to prevent wrong calculations.
